# NoodleTools Times New Roman (for footnotes)

This Chrome extension changes the NoodleTools footnote font from the default "Roboto" to Times New Roman so you don't have to change the font every time you copy and paste into a Chicago paper. Would recommend setting the "Normal Text" format for the specific Google Document to use Times New Roman as well for better cohesiveness (can look up how to do separately). I haven't found a different way to do this, as doing command+shift+v removes italics as well, so you have to change font manually.

Not much to say, basic CSS content script, I barely wrote anything; default Chrome DevTools auto selector creator and default Manifest.json file. Too lazy to put on the Webstore because I don't want to take the time to come up with icons.
